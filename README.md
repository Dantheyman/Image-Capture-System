# Control-Program-
This is the control program that I am writing for my honor project. I am working on the National Science Challenge: Bio-heritage - Urban vegetation surveillance platform
project for the university. My program currently controls image capture and storage using pyqt5 and opencv2. There is more to come like image recognition and an image 
retrival system in the future
