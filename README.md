# Image Capture System (ICS)
This is the Image Capture System that I am programing for my honor project. I am working on the National Science Challenge: Bio-heritage - Urban vegetation surveillance platform project for the university. My program currently controls image capture of two Basler ace 2 cameras via a rospy based system, a GUI using KivyMD is the current focus of my efforts (currently testing this). This is version two of the ICS as the program was rebased into ROS to solve a few problems and for future adaptability 

Note: program must currently be launched from terminal using the ros launch file from the top directory of the installation, Also the original files are not needed for the ros version of the system just there incase I need them later
