# Image Capture System (ICS)
This is the Image Capture System that I am programing for my honor project. I am working on the National Science Challenge: Bio-heritage - Urban vegetation surveillance platform project for the university. My program currently controls image capture of two Basler ace 2 cameras via a rospy based system, a GUI using KivyMD is the current focus of my efforts. This is version two of the ICS as the program was rebased into ROS to solve a few problems and for future adaptability
